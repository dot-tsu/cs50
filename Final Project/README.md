# Laggy or Not

#### Video Demo: [CS50x Final Project - Laggy or not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpTySdkt8uM)

#### Description: Laggy or Not is a web application that allows users to easily test their network latency and ping times. The application provides a simple and intuitive interface for initiating a ping test and displaying the results in a visually appealing way

## Features

The Laggy or Not application includes the following key features:

- **One-click start to begin pinging**: Users can quickly start a ping test with a single click of the "Start Pinging" button.
- **Graph showing ping over time**: The application displays a graph that visualizes the user's ping times over the course of the test.
- **Average, minimum, and maximum ping times**: In addition to the graph, the app provides numerical metrics for the average, minimum, and maximum ping times recorded during the test.

## Technologies Used

The Laggy or Not project was built using the following technologies:

- **Astro**: A modern, fast, and secure static site generator for building websites and web apps. Astro's focus on performance and developer experience made it an ideal choice for this project.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that enabled rapid development of the application's custom design and user interface.
- **TypeScript**: The inclusion of TypeScript provided type safety and better tooling support, which was particularly beneficial for the more complex parts of the codebase.
- **Chart.js**: A popular open-source data visualization library that was used to create the ping time graph, allowing for clear and informative display of the test results.

## Installation

1. Clone the project repository:

```console
git clone https://github.com/tsuramii/laggy-or-not.git
```

2. Install the dependencies:

## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank my friend Guro for the idea and name of the project. The inspiration for this application came from the need to quickly and easily test network performance, especially when dealing with potential lag or connectivity issues.

The development of Laggy or Not was a great learning experience for me, as it allowed me to explore the use of Astro, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, and Chart.js. I debated several design choices throughout the project, such as the layout and styling of the application, the choice of visualization library, and the overall user experience.

Ultimately, I decided to prioritize simplicity and ease of use, which led me to choose a minimalist design and a straightforward user flow. The use of Astro allowed me to build a fast and lightweight application, while Tailwind CSS provided a solid foundation for the styling and UI components.

I'm proud of the end result and hope that Laggy or Not can be a useful tool for anyone looking to quickly test their network performance. If you have any feedback or suggestions for improvements, please don't hesitate to contribute to the project.

The development of Laggy or Not was a significant undertaking that required a great deal of thought and planning. From the initial conception of the idea to the final implementation, I encountered numerous challenges and made several key decisions that shaped the project's direction.

One of the primary challenges I faced was determining the optimal set of features to include in the application. I wanted to strike a balance between providing a comprehensive set of tools for network testing and maintaining a clean, intuitive user interface. This required careful consideration of which metrics and visualizations would be most useful to users, and how to present that information in a way that was easy to understand and interpret.

Another key decision was the choice of technologies to use in the project. I knew from the outset that I wanted to leverage modern web development tools and frameworks to ensure the application's performance and maintainability. Astro, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, and Chart.js were all instrumental in helping me achieve this goal.

Astro, in particular, played a crucial role in the project's success. Its focus on performance and developer experience allowed me to build a fast, lightweight application that could be easily deployed and scaled. The use of TypeScript, meanwhile, provided invaluable type safety and improved tooling support, which was especially beneficial for the more complex aspects of the codebase.

Throughout the development process, I also had to make numerous design decisions that impacted the overall user experience. This included choices about the layout, color scheme, typography, and interactive elements of the application. I spent a significant amount of time iterating on these design elements, constantly seeking feedback and refining the user interface to ensure it was as intuitive and visually appealing as possible.

One of the most rewarding aspects of working on Laggy or Not was the opportunity to learn and grow as a developer. Each new challenge I faced forced me to expand my knowledge and skills, whether it was mastering a new technology, tackling a complex engineering problem, or honing my design sensibilities. This process of continuous learning and improvement has been invaluable, and it has instilled in me a deep sense of pride and accomplishment in the final product.

As I look to the future, I'm excited to continue refining and expanding the Laggy or Not application based on user feedback and new feature requests. I'm also eager to explore opportunities to collaborate with others on similar projects, as I believe that working together can lead to even more innovative and impactful solutions.

In conclusion, the development of Laggy or Not has been a truly rewarding and transformative experience for me. It has challenged me to push the boundaries of my skills and knowledge, and has allowed me to create a tool that I believe can be genuinely useful to people seeking to better understand and optimize their network performance. I'm grateful for the opportunity to have worked on this project, and I look forward to seeing where it goes from here.
