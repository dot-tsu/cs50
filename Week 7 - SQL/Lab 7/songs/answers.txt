Yet, this method has limitations. It might not fully capture emotions or music tastes because it's based
on a limited set of songs.

To improve accuracy, considering song play counts or favorites could give a better understanding.
Also, exploring more factors like tempo or personal associations with songs could provide a deeper insight
