Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

With a small number of simulations (e.g., 10 or 100 simulations), the predictions might not accurately represent the true probabilities of winning for each team. For instance, in 10 simulations, the percentages might significantly fluctuate from the actual probabilities due to the small sample size and randomness involved in each simulation.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

It seems like the predictions started stabilizing and becoming more reliable after approximately 10.000 simulations. At this point, the probabilities of winning for each team might have reached a certain level of consistency, and further increasing the number of simulations might not significantly alter these probabilities.
