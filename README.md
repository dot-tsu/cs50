# CS50x - 2023 Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the problem sets and the final project for the Harvard University's [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/) course.

> While these solutions can help you finish the course more easily, you should try to solve the problems yourself first before looking at the answers. The learning process is the most important part, so do your best to work through the problems on your own. Read the [CS50 Academic Honesty guidelines](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/honesty/) for more information.
