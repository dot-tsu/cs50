# CS50x - 2023 Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the problem sets and the final project for the Harvard University's [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/) course.

_> While these solutions can help you finish the course more easily, you should try to solve the problems yourself first before looking at the answers. The learning process is the most important part, so do your best to work through the problems on your own. Read the [CS50 Academic Honesty guidelines](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/honesty/) for more information._

⚠️ Status: No further updates or improvements will be made. The project is now archived for reference.

## Usage

To see my solutions, simply navigate to the respective week's folder and explore the solutions. Each problem set solution is contained in a separate file or folder, depending on the problem.
